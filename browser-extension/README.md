2. Verify the audit tool URL in extension popup
3. Refresh the page and try again
4. Check browser console for error messages

### Screenshots Not Appearing in Audit Tool

1. Verify the API server is running on port 3001
2. Check that CORS is properly configured
3. Look for error messages in the extension popup

### Capture Overlay Not Showing

2. Check if the page blocks content scripts
3. Some pages may prevent overlay injection

## Development

### File Structure

```
browser-extension/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json          # Extension configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.html             # Extension popup interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.js              # Popup logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content.js            # Page content script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content.css           # Content script styles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ background.js         # Background service worker
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ icons/               # Extension icons
```

### Building

The extension is ready to use as-is. For production:

1. Update the manifest version
2. Add proper icons (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128)
3. Test on multiple websites
4. Submit to Chrome Web Store

### Testing

1. Test on various websites (with and without login)
2. Test area selection accuracy
3. Verify integration with audit tool
4. Test error handling scenarios

## Security Considerations

- The extension only captures screenshots when explicitly activated
- No automatic data collection or tracking
- Screenshots are sent only to your configured audit tool
- All communication is local or to your specified audit tool URL

## Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify all setup steps are completed
3. Ensure your audit tool API server is running
4. Check network requests in browser developer tools
